## Introduction: Problems of Explenation in Economic Sociology

### Scope of the Enterprise

Levels of Econ phenomena

1. Individual economic action — satisfactions of a need within relative scarcity of resources, presumably oriented by rationality (Weber). Debate on how wide econ actions are (marriage, crime, alloc of time, etc)
2. Economic outcomes — examples: formation of stable prices, wage differential between workers
3. Institutions — Characterised by (1) larger and complex actions (2) have a sense of how things should be done.

### "Human Nature", Null Hypotheses, and Levels of Analysis: Beyond Reductionism

What are the deep underlying assumptions about human behavior held by scholars? Economists tend to endorse "applied rational choice theory", where agents maximise interests.

Sociologist less clear about their null.

Reductionism contrasts with wholism. Granovetter will try to connect both (mico and macro levels) through the meso where social structures lie (therefore their importance).

### Functionalism, Culturalism and History

Functionalism explain development of behaviors, norms and institutions as the result of addressing a specific problem and solving it. Links with evolutionary vision of society. Rely of "adaptive stories" which often skip the historical account and recount what "must have happened". Also assumes that the system is now in equilibrium, i.e. we solved the problem the institution was created for, which denies dynamics and gradualism.

Toolkit to check functionalist arguments:

1. In what sense was "the problem" really a problem?
2. Was the "solution" a solution, did it really solve it?
3. Do we understand the process through which the solution has arisen? i.e. we cannot assume the problem is automatically solved.
4. Why *this particular* solution? What is the range of possible solutions, and under what circumstances might other arise?

Functionalist answer seem plausible because institutions well sutited to economic environment. But insitutions might adapt the environment to match their existence.

Thus, hsitorical accounts are central in order to study the dynamics. Leads the way to "path dependence": once a technology has a temproray lead, the others tend to adapt to the leader in order to intergrate and get a share of the pie. Competitive techno become less profitable. Some technologies may become locked in by events. This can aply to institutions.

Culturalism is based on a the social capital different groups own and how it predicts economic outcomes. "Protestant ethics" is an example. Renders individual behavior automatic once culture accounted for, according to Granovetter.

### Under- and Oversocialized Conceptions of Human Action

Economists, Parsons, proponents of undersocialized. Perfect markets reflect that vision: anonymous, perfectly informed agents, no repeted interactions, no relationships between each other.

Oversocialized visions forbid any individual agency, and thus also atomize the agents in the same way undersocialized visions do.

### Social Networks and "Embedness"

The mesolevel helps avoid these two extremes. "Social networks matter because people's pursuit of both social and economic goals invariably involve known others as a significant element." i.e. individuals are embedded in networks of known others.

*Relational embeddedness* relates to relationships individuals have with specific individuals, in pairs, e.g. employee and manager relationship.

*Structural embeddedness* relates to the impact of the overall structure of the network in which individuals are embedded in. More indirect effects. Worker's relationship with manager will be impacted by the relation of all workers with management. In more dense networks, individuals absorb more norms from the group, and available information is also impacted.

*Temporal embeddedness* is the fact that relationships do not start fresh each new meeting, but a lot of stuff is carried over even through extended periods of time. Time is often overlooked [c.f. Bourdieu in Anthropologie Economique].

#### Networks and Norms

Norms – shared ideas about normal and appropriate behaviour – are more firmly held, easier to enforce the more dense the social network. In dense networks, each node is more connected to othe nodes, so information (ideas, influences) can travel through more channels. Makes it harder to hide deviance from norms to network, and more likely that norms be discussed and circulated.

#### The Strenght of Weak Ties

"New information is more likely to reach individuals through their weak ties", since closest friends evolve in very similar networks, the information is not novel, more circularity in information. Acquaintances are "windows on a wider world."

#### Structural holes

"Individuals with ties into multiple networks largely separated from one another may enjoy strategic advantage." They become the only communication route, and are able to exploit the structural hole, becoming effective brokers and enjoying substancial social capital.

### A Vocabulary of Individual Motives

Behaviour may be instrumentally rational or not, ego-oriented or not, economically or socially oriented.

Instrumental (a mean to achieve an end) vs consummatory (an end in itself)

Ego-oriented vs altruism

Economic vs social (power, sociability, approval, etc.) goods. Most of behavior is a mixture of both: since most of our actions take place with known others, we also seek social good along with economic goods, which is in fact often easier to pursue simultaneously.

## The Impact of Mental Constructs on Economic Actions: Norms, Values, and Moral Economy

### Introduction

Importance of norms in the economy, economic actions and outcomes. Norms are principles people acknowledge about the appropriate way to conduct themselves, and these are socially shared and enforced informally by others. Values is broader and relates to what is good in life and in society, less specific than norms.

### What Are Economic Norms, and Why Do They Influence Economic Actors?

Rational choice would say that people follow norms when it benefits them (cost-benefit analysis). The fact is that norms are internalized and obedience to them does not rely on calculation, on the contrary. Moreover, holding the calculatory view and applying to many real-life situations, one would realize that we most of the time have interest in not conforming and break the law, lie etc whenever we can. Which is not was is happening.

So why conform? Because of enforcement by others, which reactions lead to emotional responses for deviating individuals. Guilt and shame are, according to Elster, the drivers of norms, as they are the most powerful (negative) emotions one can experience, and people want to avoid them absolutely. Positive emotions can also drive behavior (e.g. anger and indignation) in some circumstances, but less prominent for Granovetter.

Since norms are internalized, emotions seem fit as the explaining force. So why some social situations elicit strong emotional responses? Mostly because of others' reactions. We must *care* about what others think to be affected by their reactions to our actions. Thus we need to study who serves as the feedback provider for individuals, i.e. reference group, which is not necessarily local (i.e. within the immediate entourage of individuals). Can be profession-based, for example.

How does self-interest and norms interact? Elster argues it's a compromise between both. Norms might be seen as a "shift parameter", changing the cost of alternatives (econ view). But emotions can severely cloud an individual's thinking to the detriment of her interests, replies Elster [but even that could be modelled within utility in some way]. Case of "sacred values" also problematic.

### The Origins, Content and Efficiency of Norms

Some suspect evolutionary / coevolutionary origins, as maximiying efficiency over time. Other postulate that groups develop norms that minimiye deadweight losses. Again, functionalist arguments. Some see observance and enforcement of norms as a way to enhance ones reputation and encourage later cooperation with herself. The litterature generally thinks norms arise from small cohesive groups. But these small groups can produce norms with negative extarnalities for the outsiders, and the opposite is also possible.

Importantly, specific norms should be studied with related ones.

### How Do We Know That Norms Matter?: The Problem of "Moral Economy"

Experiments have shown evidence of reciprocity when self-interest would have predict differently.

Moral economy is the minimum moral requirements of economic actions to avoid being opposed. Reference prices are an expression of that. What people consider a normal price is part of the moral economy. Or the fact that employers do not decrease wages in times of economic downturn like economics would suggest: employers know that this will be destructive and shatter relationships with workers. Moral commitment is believed, by managers themselves, to be the backbone of productivity. Goes back to the idea that a "purely utilitarian world is chaotic and unstable" (Hobbes).

Moral economy seems to rely on cohesive groups with personal ties, as shown by ethnographic evidence.

### A Preface to the Study of Culture and Institutions

According to Granovetter, it is **misleading** to (1) analyze the origins and functionings of single norms in isolation and (2) that norms operate effectively only in small, localized social networks.

## Trust in the Economy

### Introduction: The Concept of Trust

Trust and trust worthy behaviour key to economy: allow people to collaborate and act more nicely than what pure self-interest would predict. Saves substantial costs. Came back to the forefront with "moral hazard" and "adverse selection" issues.

Elinor Ostrom: "How do communities of individuals sustain agreements that counteract individual temptations to select short-term, hedonistic actions when all parties would be better off if each party selected actions leading to higher group and individual returns? In other words, how do groups of individuals gain trust?"

Broadly accepted definition: trust is the belief that another person with whom you might interact will not cause you harm even though he or she is in a position to do so. The trustor put herself at risk of being abused by the trustee. Risk is central to all definitions of trust.

Many different reasons for trust lead to different definitions.

### The Sources of Trust

#### Trust based on knowledge or calculation of interests of the other (rational choice accounts)

Is it in one's own benefit to trust someone else? If yes, will trust. Issues of circularity of argument, cognitive capacity and information acquisition to make such assessments. Moreover, issues when every agent is supposed to have this source of trust.

Encapsulated interest: one's interests are encapsulated into another person's interests. Only works with others you know closely.

Difficult to disentangle consumatory and instrumental cases of trust, because also often mixed.

#### Trust based on personal relationships

Trust with people with whom one exchanges often. 

#### Trust based on membership in groups and networks

People in groups tend to trust each other more, because of "structural embeddedness." Stereotype-based, or "group heuristic hypothesis" where we expect more altruistic behavior between members of groups. Others postulate that identity plays a role in group trust. Close-knit communities monitor each other more closely.

#### Institutional sources of trust

People trust each other because institutional arrangements make betrayal less likely. Some evolutionary arguments make reason that societies needed to move beyond small-scale trust when complexity increased. We do not need to subscribe to such arguments to acknowledge the importance of institutions.

#### Trust based on norms

One might trust because that is what the norm prescribes. Some postulate that norms come from culture, and cite the World Value Survey's (WVS) question "Generally speaking, do you think most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?" Does not solve the question of where these preferences come from, taken as given from "culture." Base their arguments on Fukuyama and Putnam, the later proposing that trust results from social capital and thus social capital may measure trust. Norms may be transmitted by parents and thought as a decision that groups make in order to maximise chances for children.

In most cases, sources of trust are mixed.

### More on the Definition of Trust and the Scope Conditions for the Concept

Focus on the circumstances that allow economic agents to trust each other, i.e. to make themselves vulnerable to others. The author will not confine to small-scale nor large-scales situations, but all situations where agents will put themselves at risk of others hurting their interests.

### The Aggregation of Trust from Interpersonal to More Macro levels

On small-scale levels, both interests and norms bear on trust.

The Scottish argument posits that the market has changed the nature of trust, because business partners do not need to be friends "with benefits" and can rely solely on emotions and sentiments.

Fukuyama argues that small-scale trust determines the macro-level of trust. Examples are given regarding family structures and types of business, where "high trust" scoieties have more professionally managed corporations. However, this argument is difficult to hold (Korea, Chinese conglomerates).

Close-knit communities would generate networks with many rival cliques, making trust difficult. The leader should be personally backed by a member of the clique for the clique to support him: chain of personal links that conveys trust. Thus, the importance of the leader's network and the key actors to know. A little trust goes a long way: knowing the right people matters, thus the structure of the network matters. Chinese family conglomerate example.

### Trust, Norms and Power

Large economic organizations often combine trust, norms and power. But trust is an essential component of the equation. The persistence of family business against standard economic reasoning is an argument in favour of that view, probably because trust can be found and is more more easily enforced within families, although there is definitly an amount of power in these structures too.

## Power in the economy

### Introduction: the Varieties of Power in the Economy

Weber's definition: "power is the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which this probability rests." Definition is agnostic to sources of power. Defines domination as the probability that a command will be obeyed by a given group of person.

#### Economic Power Based on Dependence

Broadly the most common notion about power. Someone who controls resources others need has power of them, because they are dependent on him. Equivalent to market power, related to monopolies. Market power vs class power: difference lies in the alternatives the dependent person or group has.

Ways to get rid of dependence: (1) decrease value of that resource, (2) find another, more convinient partner. 

Some distinguish positive and negative dependence: the former focusing on the gains when obtaining the resources coveted, the latter emphasising punishement and how to avoid it.

Dependence forces the less powerful to exchange at lower rates that they could otherwise.

Those who have nothing to offer, exchange resources with deference, which is can be thought as a form a credit.

Groups can also manipulate the value of a resource they hold in order to gain power through dependence.

Special case when dependence is symmetrical, which may lead to more collaborative relationships and a "culture of trust". Shows how intertwined these concepts are.

#### Economic Power Based on Legitimacy

Power derives from the legitimacy of the actor, and whether she is entitled to be obeyed. Much cheaper way of enforcing one's will than coercive power. Empirically, it is shown that people, at all levels, follow the rules much more than what could be avoided.

Weber's legitimacy grounds for following the law: (1) "legal-rational", where agents hold moral values or believe that the system is legitimate, (2) traditional authority, (3) charismatic grounds. Identity is not to be forgotten, as members of groups might be more willing to follow group rules.

#### Economic Power Based on Control of Agenda and Discourse
