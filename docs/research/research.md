### Bicycle-share systems: cycling toward cleaner cities? Evidence from New York City.

<details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
<p>
What is the impact of increasing the supply of bicycles on air pollution in cities? While research has shown that policies such as increasing the supply of public transport and limiting the access of road vehicles to urban centers decrease pollution, little is known about the effects of increasing bicycle supply. As a non-polluting alternative to public and private transport, bicycles have the potential to alleviate cities of burdens such as pollution and congestion. This paper takes advantage of the gradual roll-out of the bicycle-share system in New York City since 2013 to estimate the impact of a sharp, sudden and well-defined in time and space decrease in the relative price of cycling. I use a staggered difference-in-differences approach, comparing areas covered by bicycle-share to non-covered ones, before and after the roll-out. I use highly disaggregated pollution data and investigate the impact of bicycle-sharing on pollution at a local scale. Results show that the bicycle-share system's arrival significantly decreased the black carbon and nitric oxide concentrations of treated areas, while particulate matter seems unaffected.

<details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
<p>
Non-cognitive skills are increasingly recognized as important determinants of labor market outcomes. To what extent these skills can be affected in adulthood remains an open question. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with low-skilled employed workers in Senegal where workers were randomly assigned to receive a training intervention designed to affect conscientiousness traits. We found that treated workers were significantly more likely to stay in their job and have higher wages nine months after the intervention. Our findings suggest that non-cognitive skills can be affected even later in the life cycle and can have substantial labor market returns.

<details><summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
<p>
I investigate the impact of the presence of cooperatives on forced displacement due to the conflict in Colombia. I postulate that integrative firm structures make individuals and their households more resilient to conflict consequences, thus lowering displacement due to conflict violence in municipalities with higher cooperative presence. I use extensive governmental data on Colombian cooperatives, displacement and a set of controls, all on the municipal level from 2003 to 2013. Zero-inflated beta models are employed to account for features of the dependent variable (a fraction with an excess of zeros). Results suggest that the number of cooperative membership rate is a significant (negative) predictor of the rate of displaced people, and these estimates are robust to a number of alternative specifications. These results support the case for the social and solidarity economy in unstable countries, as they seem to provide communities with resilience to violent contexts.
