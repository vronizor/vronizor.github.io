  What is the impact of cycling on cities' air quality? This paper leverages the staggered roll-out of New York City's bike share program to estimate the effect of cycling on air pollution concentrations. I combine the universe of bike share trips with ground-level, high-resolution observational air ollution measures between 2009 and 2019. The bike share data is used to map areas served by bike share, which I compare to unserved areas using a staggered difference-in-differences strategy to retrieve causal estimates. I find that the arrival of bike share is associated with a 3 to 13% reduction in the concentrations of pollutants associated with road traffic. In addition, I show that the introduction of bike share is associated with a decrease in short taxi trips in areas served by bike share, which I interpret as suggestive evidence that bike share reduces road traffic.

  Non-cognitive skills are increasingly recognized as important determinants of labor market outcomes. To what extent these skills can be affected in adulthood remains an open question. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with low-skilled employed workers in Senegal where workers were randomly assigned to receive a training intervention designed to affect conscientiousness traits. We found that treated workers were significantly more likely to stay in their job and have higher wages nine months after the intervention. Our findings suggest that non-cognitive skills can be affected even later in the life cycle and can have substantial labor market returns.

<p>
I investigate the impact of the presence of cooperatives on forced displacement due to the conflict in Colombia. I postulate that integrative firm structures make individuals and their households more resilient to conflict consequences, thus lowering displacement due to conflict violence in municipalities with higher cooperative presence. I use extensive governmental data on Colombian cooperatives, displacement and a set of controls, all on the municipal level from 2003 to 2013. Zero-inflated beta models are employed to account for features of the dependent variable (a fraction with an excess of zeros). Results suggest that the number of cooperative membership rate is a significant (negative) predictor of the rate of displaced people, and these estimates are robust to a number of alternative specifications. These results support the case for the social and solidarity economy in unstable countries, as they seem to provide communities with resilience to violent contexts.
