**[Sticking Together: The impact of cooperatives on forced displacement in Colombia]({{ site.url }}/docs/research/assets/coop-colombia/coop-colombia.pdf)**  MSc Thesis, Universitat de Barcelona, 2018. Advisor: Prof. [Enrique López-Bazo](https://ideas.repec.org/e/plo11.html).

<span id="dots"> </span><span id="abst">In this paper, I investigate the impact of the presence of cooperatives on forced displacement due to the conflict in Colombia. I postulate that integrative firm structures make individuals and their households more resilient to conflict consequences, thus lowering displacement due to conflict violence in municipalities with higher cooperative presence. I use extensive governmental data on Colombian cooperatives, displacement and a set of controls, all on the municipal level from 2003 to 2013. Zero-inflated beta models are employed to account for features of the dependent variable (a fraction with an excess of zeros). Results suggest that the number of cooperative membership rate is a significant (negative) predictor of the rate of displaced people, and these estimates are robust to a number of alternative specifications. These results support the case for the social and solidarity economy in unstable countries, as they seem to provide communities with resilience to violent contexts.</span>
