## Sampling methods

### Simple random sampling

- All observation have the same probability of being sampled

### Stratified sampling

- Dividing dataset in mutually exclusive + collectively exhaustive stratas.
- Sample x% of each strata
- Advantage
  - precision
  - every strata represented

### Cluster sampling

- Dividing dataset in mutually exclusive + collectively exhaustive clusters
- Randomly select some clusters
-  Advantage: cost

## Sampling distribution

- Drawing samples gives you a *single distribution of values of X*
- Each sample produces a *sample mean*
- If you draw multiple samples, you get multiple means, called a *sampling distribution*

Will converge to the mean of pop $ \mu $

Standard error of sample mean $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

If the population is normal, then the sampling distribution is also normal, thus we can standardiye it.
