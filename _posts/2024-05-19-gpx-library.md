I'm starting a repository of GPX routes of (usually) self-supported bike races with fixed routes. These routes can serve as inspiration for my own bike trips, or as reference for anyone out there curious about them. So far I'm following these races (links point to official websites):

- [Accursed Race](https://www.lostdot.cc/race-brand/the-accursed-race)
- [Atlas Mountain Race](https://www.atlasmountainrace.com/)
- [French Divide](https://www.frenchdivide.com)
- [Hellenic Mountain Race](https://www.hellenicmountainrace.cc/)
- [Leman Gravel Challenge](https://www.lausannegravel.cc/lgc)
- [Pan Celtic Race](https://pancelticrace.com)
- [Pedals de Foc Non Stop ](https://www.pdfnonstop.com/)
- [Silk Road Mountain Race](https://www.silkroadmountainrace.com/)
- [Tour Divide](https://tourdivide.org/)
- [Transpyrenees (Transiberica)](https://www.transiberica.club/transpyrenees/)

Planned additions: none for now — get in touch if you want to see other race routes!

Cool races that *do not* follow a fixed route:

- [Transcontinental Race](https://www.lostdot.cc/race-brand/transcontinental)

Many other great bikepacking routes that are not races can be found on [Bikepacking.com](https://bikepacking.com/bikepacking-routes/).

Files are provided in GPX (ideal for GPS devices) and GeoJSON (more practical for GIS work and mapping). To visualise the files, you can simply drag-and-drop them into [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) — let me know if you spot any mistakes and/or files not working!
