# Where and who are the forcibly displaced?

Colombia has suffered many decades of civil unrest. From the late 60s to 2016, conflict has burdened the country and brought many negative consequences in various aspect of the country's life. In particular, forced internal displacement has been a notable feature of the Colombian conflict. In total, more than 7 million people—or 10% of the population—were displaced, inflicting serious issues on Colombian society.

But who are these forcibly displaced people? Since 1995, the Colombian government has been gathering and centralizing information on victims of the conflict. Renamed and reorganized several times under various ministries, the *Registro Único de Víctimas* (Central Register of Victims, RUV)  lists all conflict victims—we will focus on forcibly displaced people, which represent around 80% of all victims.

Data is gathered thanks to reparation policies of the government for which victims have to sign up in order to benefit from. Important to mention are the reserves some researchers have voiced against this database, which could underestimate displacement by as much as 30% due to victim's lack of knowledge registration, fear or shame [^1]. Nevertheless, RUV constitutes the best, readily usable dataset of conflict victims in Colombia and has been widely used in previous research.

The database, which provides number of displaced persons at the municipal level, is rich in victims' characteristics: it records gender, age group, ethnicity and disability. This enables us to precisely map displacement and observe potential spatial heterogeneity in victim's attributes.
