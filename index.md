I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Sustainable Long-Distance Mobility Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/pse-partnership-programme/chairs/chair-sustainable-long-distance-mobility/) at the Paris School of Economics. I was previously a PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin, where I was an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar and affiliated to the [Trinity Impact Evaluation](https://www.tcd.ie/time/) research centre.

I am an applied microeconomist with interests in **urban**, **development** and **environmental** economics. My [Job Market Paper](assets/doc/thorne-jmp_cycling-cleaner_latest.pdf) examines the impact of cycling infrastructure on air pollution concentrations in New York City. 

You can learn more about my research on [this page]({{ site.url }}/docs/research/research.html). I occasionally [blog]({{ site.url }}/docs/blog.html) about coding and data analysis. You can also download my [CV](/assets/doc/thorne_cv.pdf), or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vincent_thorne) or <a rel="me" href="https://econtwitter.net/@vinceth">Mastodon</a>.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to [email me](mailto:vincent[dot]thorne[at]psemail[dot]eu), or book a slot during my [office hours](https://app.reclaim.ai/m/vinceth/office-hours).
