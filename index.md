I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Sustainable Long-Distance Mobility Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/pse-partnership-programme/chairs/chair-sustainable-long-distance-mobility/) at the Paris School of Economics. I was previously a PhD candidate at Trinity College Dublin, where I was an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar and affiliated to the [Trinity Impact Evaluation](https://www.tcd.ie/time/) research centre.

I am an applied microeconomist with interests in **urban**, **development** and **environmental** economics. My [Job Market Paper](assets/doc/thorne-jmp_cycling-cleaner_latest.pdf) examines the impact of cycling infrastructure on air pollution concentrations in New York City.
