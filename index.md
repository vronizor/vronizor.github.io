I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at Trinity College Dublin, an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar, and affiliated to the [Trinity Impact Evaluation](https://www.tcd.ie/time/) research centre. In September 2023, I will join the Paris School Economics as a Postdoc Researcher at the [Sustainable Long-Distance Mobility Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/pse-partnership-programme/chairs/chair-sustainable-long-distance-mobility/).

I am an applied microeconomist with interests in **urban**, **development** and **environmental** economics. My [Job Market Paper](assets/doc/thorne-jmp_cycling-cleaner_latest.pdf) examines the impact of cycling infrastructure on air pollution concentrations.
