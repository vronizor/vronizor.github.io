I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at Trinity College, Dublin, an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar, and affiliated to [Trinity Impact Evaluation](https://www.tcd.ie/time/) research unit.

I am an applied microeconomist with interests in urban economics, development economics and environmental economics. My current work focuses on cities and the impact that transport innovations and investments have on their environment and populations. 

My [Job Market Paper](assets/doc/thorne-jmp_cycling-cleaner_latest.pdf) examines the impact of cycling infrastructure on air pollution concentrations, leveraging the staggered rollout of New York City's bike share system to estimate causal effects. 

I am on the 2022â€“2023 European Job Market. You can download my [CV](/assets/doc/thorne-cv.pdf) for further information, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vincent_thorne), or get in touch by email: [thornev\[at\]tcd\[dot\]ie](mailto:thornev[at]tcd[dot]ie).

You can learn more about my research on [this page]({{ site.url }}/docs/research/research.html). I occasionaly [blog]({{ site.url }}/docs/blog.html) about coding and data analysis.
