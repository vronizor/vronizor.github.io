I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at Trinity College Dublin, an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar, and affiliated to the [Trinity Impact Evaluation](https://www.tcd.ie/time/) research centre.

I am an applied microeconomist with interests in **urban**, **development** and **environmental** economics. 

My [Job Market Paper](assets/doc/thorne-jmp_cycling-cleaner_latest.pdf) examines the impact of cycling infrastructure on air pollution concentrations.
