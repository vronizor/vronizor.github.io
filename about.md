I am a PhD candidate in the [economics department](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/). I am interested in development economics and how social structures impact development and economic outcomes.

Appart from research, I enjoy [cycling](https://www.couraillon.cc/), [history podcasts](https://www.revolutionspodcast.com/) and photography.
