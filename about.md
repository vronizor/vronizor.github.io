I am a PhD candidate in the [economics department](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/). I am interested in urban and development economics.

Apart from research, I enjoy [cycling](https://couraillon.cc/), [history podcasts](/docs/podcasts.html) and photography.
