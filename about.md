I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) and an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar. 

My research focuses on urban economics looking at transport and environmental issues, with a secondary focus on developing economies. My first paper investigates the relationship between expanding bicycle-share and air pollution in New York City. In another project in collaboration with the World Bank, we study the impact of constructing new urban transport infrastructure on the local labor force in Dakar, Senegal. You can find out more about my research [here]({{ site.url }}/docs/research/research.html) and download my CV [here](/assets/doc/CV.pdf).

Apart from research, I enjoy [cycling](https://couraillon.cc/), [history podcasts](/docs/podcasts.html) and photography.
