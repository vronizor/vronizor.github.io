I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.tcd.ie/Economics/) at [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) and an [Irish Research Council](https://research.ie/) Scholar. My research focuses on urban and environmental economics, with a secondary focus on developing countries. My first paper investigates the relationship between expanding bicycle-share and pollution in New York City. In another project in collaboration with the World Bank, I study the impact of constructing new urban transport infrastructure on the local labor force in Dakar, Senegal. You can find out more about my research [here]({{ site.url }}/docs/research/research.html) and download my CV [here](/assets/doc/CV.pdf).

Apart from research, I enjoy [cycling](https://couraillon.cc/), [history podcasts](/docs/podcasts.html) and photography.
